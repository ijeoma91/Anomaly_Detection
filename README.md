# Anomaly_Detection

## Project Description
This project is a Machine Learning project that it main focus is to build model that detect Anomaly in an organization. The organization  produce Wind Turbine components, during their production of the wind Turbine machine components, all possible tracking and monitoring sensors were used to monitor the production period. The sensor main attributes are Time, humidity, temperature and sound. This project main focus is build an anomaly detection model that detect what the sensor observed or something unusual during the production period.


# Getting Started..

## Dependencies
For the model, there are differents dependencies feature that needed to be imported before the model can work.

. Pandas: For data analysis, cleaning, exploring and manipulating data

. Numpy: This is for arry-processing package

. sklearn (import IsplationForest)

. Matplotlib: Data visualizations and Graphical plotting

. pickle: It helps to transport data over the network so as to have access to other file

. Flask: Used to build web application
